You just would choose the addition option, put in how many numbers you would like to add (Example: You type "4"), you would then be promted with a screen asking what the numbers you would like to add, all you would have to do is type out the four numbers followed by enter (Example: 44 23 2 19), the program will then result your sum (Example: "Your Result is 88")
  
  - The subtraction function is still in progress and at the moment only subtracts two numbers together. The format will be the same as the addition.
  
  - The multiplication is very similar to the addition. It can multiply as many numbers are you need together.
